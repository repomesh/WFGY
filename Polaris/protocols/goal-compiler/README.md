Natural language is a powerful interface.

But for complex AI work, raw natural language is not always a safe execution contract.

**Polaris Goal Compiler** adds the missing protocol layer between the human and the AI. Before the assistant starts producing work that looks finished, it must first turn the request into visible task atoms, active work, blocked work, verification gates, truth objects, and claim ceilings.

This is not a normal prompt template.

It is a portable TXT based execution protocol for making complex AI work easier to inspect, harder to fake, and less likely to collapse into premature completion.

## What This Is

Polaris Goal Compiler is the first public protocol component released under the WFGY 5.0 Polaris line.

It is designed for a very specific failure pattern:

> The user gives a complex task.  
> The AI starts writing a polished answer.  
> But the real task boundary was never compiled, verified, or closed.

Polaris Goal Compiler changes the starting point.

Instead of letting the assistant execute raw natural language directly, it asks the assistant to first produce an execution structure.

That structure makes visible:

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| Active work | What can be done now |
| Blocked work | What must wait |
| Task atoms | The smallest executable units |
| Verification gates | What must be checked before unlock |
| Truth objects | What must actually become true |
| Claim ceilings | What the assistant is allowed to claim |
| Closure records | What is done, missing, partial, or unsafe |

The core idea is simple:

> AI should not produce work that merely looks complete.  
> It should expose what is active, what is blocked, what is verified, and what still cannot be claimed.

## 60 Second Experience

You can test Polaris Goal Compiler in about one minute.

### Step 1

Download:

[`POLARIS_GOAL_COMPILER.txt`](./POLARIS_GOAL_COMPILER.txt)

### Step 2

Paste it into one of these places:

| Place | Use case |
|---|---|
| Ordinary AI chat | Fast manual test |
| Custom instructions | Persistent assistant behavior |
| Project rules | Coding assistant or repo level work |
| Agent rule layer | Multi step agent workflows |
| Future skill file | Wrapped protocol runtime |

### Step 3

Ask the AI:

```text
Use Polaris Goal Compiler.

First compile my request into task atoms.
Then execute only the active atom.
Do not claim final completion until verification is shown.
````

### Step 4

Give it a mixed task.

```text
Review this file, find the risky parts, repair the structure, verify what changed, and then write a short public release note.

Do not start writing the release note first.
Compile the task into atoms.
Show what is active and what is blocked.
Only execute the first active atom.
```

### What you should see

The assistant should not jump directly into the release note.

It should first separate the work.

```text
A01 Define the target
A02 Locate risky parts
A03 Repair structure
A04 Verify repair
A05 Explain verified changes
A06 Write release note
```

Only the first unlocked atom should execute.

Everything downstream should remain blocked until the required upstream state is verified.

## Position in WFGY 5.0

Polaris Goal Compiler is one public protocol component under **WFGY 5.0 Polaris Protocol**.

It does not expose the full private mathematical engine.

It releases a practical human AI execution layer that users can download, paste, and test immediately.

| Layer                              | Status                               |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Human AI execution protocol        | Public through Polaris Goal Compiler |
| Portable TXT rule                  | Public                               |
| Future skill compatibility         | Designed into the structure          |
| Full WFGY 5.0 internal engine      | Not fully released here              |
| Future Polaris protocol components | Planned gradually                    |

This release follows the Polaris direction:

> expose useful public protocol layers first, then release deeper engine materials over time.

<a id="why-this-exists"></a>

## Why This Exists

Most AI failures in long tasks do not begin at the final answer.

They begin at the first boundary cut.

For simple tasks, natural language is often enough.

For complex tasks, raw natural language can become too blurry.

A user may say:

```text
Review this, fix it, verify it, and write the announcement.
```

To a model, that can collapse into one blended task.

The assistant may silently do this:

```text
review + repair + verify + explain + publish
```

as one surface level answer.

That is where fake completion begins.

| Failure                   | What happens                                         |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Goal merging              | Several tasks become one blurry task                 |
| Verification skipping     | The assistant writes as if checks already happened   |
| Premature prose           | Public explanation appears before truth work is done |
| Local to global promotion | One local step becomes fake total completion         |
| Unsupported readiness     | The assistant claims done before proof exists        |

Polaris Goal Compiler exists to stop that first collapse.

It puts a protocol between the human request and the assistant action.

<a id="why-it-works"></a>

## Why It Works

The mechanism is not magic.

It is task boundary control.

AI assistants are strong at pattern following. When every round exposes the same execution structure, the model receives a stable operating pattern.

Instead of guessing the whole task from raw natural language, the assistant sees a structured contract:

```text
What is active?
What is blocked?
What must be verified?
What is the truth object?
What is the claim ceiling?
What remains unresolved?
```

That repeated structure is friendly to AI behavior.

It tells the assistant:

| Signal            | Effect                               |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Active atom       | Do this now                          |
| Blocked atom      | Do not do this yet                   |
| Verification gate | Check before unlock                  |
| Truth object      | Do not confuse prose with completion |
| Claim ceiling     | Do not overstate readiness           |
| Closure record    | Preserve continuity across rounds    |

In plain language:

> The clearer the first boundary, the fewer chances the task has to drift.

This does not guarantee correctness.

It reduces the risk of hallucination and fake completion by making the execution boundary visible before the model starts writing.

## Capability Map

Polaris Goal Compiler is built around execution control layers.

| Capability            | What it does                                               | What it prevents                                     |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Goal Compilation      | Converts raw user language into executable task structure  | Starting from an ambiguous request                   |
| Task Graph            | Maps atoms, dependencies, blocking edges, and unlock order | Jumping to downstream work too early                 |
| Count Board           | Separates task count, package count, and active atom count | Treating one local unit as the whole job             |
| Atom Table            | Records each task as a visible executable unit             | Mixing repair, verification, and writing in one step |
| Execution Token Board | Grants or denies execution authority per atom              | Doing work that has not been unlocked                |
| Round Lock            | Freezes one active atom for the current round              | Multi task drift inside one answer                   |
| Truth Object          | Defines what must actually become true                     | Treating readable prose as proof                     |
| Claim Ceiling         | Limits how strongly the assistant may claim completion     | Local success becoming fake global completion        |
| Downstream Leak Audit | Detects later stage content leaking too early              | Writing announcements before verification            |
| Closure Record        | Records verified state, missing parts, and remaining gap   | Losing track across long workflows                   |
| Portable TXT Mode     | Allows the protocol to run without a special app           | Locking the protocol to one interface                |
| Skill Compatibility   | Keeps the structure ready for future skill wrapping        | Turning the protocol into a dead document            |

The protocol is designed to make complex work more inspectable.

It does not only ask the assistant to be careful.

It gives the assistant a structure for knowing what careful means.

<a id="execution-flow"></a>

## Execution Flow

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Raw human request] --> B[Goal Compilation]
    B --> C[Task Graph]
    C --> D[Atom Table]
    D --> E[Execution Token Board]
    E --> F[Round Lock]
    F --> G[Execute one active atom]
    G --> H[Verification Gate]
    H --> I{Verified?}
    I -->|Yes| J[Unlock next atom]
    I -->|No| K[Record missing gap]
    J --> L[Closure Record]
    K --> L
    L --> M[Claim Ceiling Control]
    M --> N[Supported output only]
```

This flow is the practical core.

The assistant should not move from a raw request to final prose directly.

It should pass through compilation, authorization, execution, verification, closure, and claim control.

[Back to top](#top)

<a id="recommended-first-test"></a>

## Recommended First Test

Use a task that normally tempts an AI assistant to mix stages.

```text
Use Polaris Goal Compiler.

I need you to review a file, find the risky parts, repair the structure, explain what changed, and then write a short public release note.

Do not start writing the release note first.
Compile the task into atoms.
Show what is active and what is blocked.
Only execute the first active atom.
```

A good response should not immediately write the release note.

It should first produce a structure like this:

| Atom | Class              | State   |
| ---- | ------------------ | ------- |
| A01  | Define target      | Active  |
| A02  | Locate risky parts | Blocked |
| A03  | Repair structure   | Blocked |
| A04  | Verify repair      | Blocked |
| A05  | Explain changes    | Blocked |
| A06  | Write release note | Blocked |

The exact format may vary.

The required behavior should not vary:

> Compile first.
> Execute one active atom.
> Verify before unlock.
> Do not claim final completion too early.

<a id="what-this-does-not-claim"></a>

## What This Does Not Claim

Polaris Goal Compiler is intentionally practical and bounded.

It does not claim:

| Not claimed                        | Why                                               |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Universal correctness              | No protocol can guarantee every answer is correct |
| Complete hallucination elimination | The goal is risk reduction, not magical removal   |
| Replacement for tests              | Real verification still matters                   |
| Replacement for sources            | Factual work still needs evidence                 |
| Replacement for expertise          | Domain judgment still matters                     |
| Full WFGY 5.0 release              | This is one public protocol component             |
| Formal benchmark proof             | Current effect map is informal until measured     |

What it does claim:

| Claimed                           | Meaning                                                |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| Better task boundary visibility   | The assistant must show active and blocked work        |
| Better fake completion resistance | Local progress cannot silently become final completion |
| Better verification awareness     | Missing checks become visible                          |
| Better claim control              | The assistant should not overstate readiness           |
| Better long task continuity       | Rounds can preserve state more clearly                 |

In one sentence:

> Polaris Goal Compiler does not make the model omniscient. It makes the task interface harder to fake.

## Part of WFGY 5.0 Polaris Protocol

Polaris Goal Compiler is one public protocol release under the WFGY 5.0 Polaris line.

More protocol components will be released gradually.

The goal is to make AI workflows:

| Direction                         | Meaning                                                |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| More structured                   | Tasks are compiled before execution                    |
| More inspectable                  | Active, blocked, and verified states are visible       |
| Less ambiguous                    | Natural language is converted into execution structure |
| Harder to fake as complete        | Completion claims must respect verification state      |
| Easier to wrap into future skills | TXT protocol can become runtime structure later        |
